Using version control is an interesting concept.

I like how the diff function has '+','-' and '' to tell the changes made (or not).

Hence, this helps to save a lot of time when identifying the bug.

And that's cool!

I love to save time.

:)

Hmm.. that's an interesting question.

Initially, I thought it kinda looks a bit messy.

But then again, I guess it'd be useful when I made some mistakes.

As it would help me revert to an older version.

Thus, saving proofreading time.

I'd think that saving manually would be good as we can save scripts with logical difference.

But forgeting to save could be a potential limitation to manual savings too.

Tracking multiple files at one go allows the user to track simultaneous changes.

git log tells you what changes have been made.

git diff tells you the difference between the two IDs

git log --stat is really a combination of log and diff

Well with git checkout, i get to revert back to a older workable version which is reassuring.

Now that I've my workspace set up, I'd like to try some commits.
